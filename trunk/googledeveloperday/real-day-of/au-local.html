During this time the workshop employed approximately 3,000 skilled workers who included tinsmiths, coppersmiths, blacksmiths, boilermakers, fitters, turners, grinders, machinists and toolmakers to name a few. They worked side-by-side in what was, at the time, the largest industrial complex in Australia. The workshop started to decline with the age of diesel and the last steam engine passenger service was made in 1963. The workshop eventually closed in 1989.&nbsp; </p><p>  If you're looking for things to do close to the city, here are a few highlights :</p><ul style="list-style:disc; padding-left:2.5em;">  <li>Botanic      Gardens - acres of lush landscape</li>  <li>Chinatown - Eastern culture, food and arts</li>  <li>Circular Quay      - meeting place with cafes, bars and ferry terminal</li>  <li>Cockle Bay - a waterside boulevard of      restaurants, cafes and bars</li>  <li>Darling Harbour - waterside dining and entertainment</li>  <li>Pitt Street      Mall - shopping along a CBD pedestrian thoroughfare</li>  <li>Paddington -      designer fashions and stylish stores</li>  <li>Queen Victoria       Building - a historic site that hosts a      shopper's paradise of designer stores</li>  <li>Sydney Harbour       Bridge and Opera House</li>  <li>Sydney Tower </li>  <li>The Rocks - historical colonial site </li></ul>
