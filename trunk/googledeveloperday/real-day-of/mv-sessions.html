Google SketchUp is a 3D modeling tool used to model buildings for Google Earth, visualize interiors, design furniture and basically work in 3D. With the latest release of Google SketchUp 6, you can now use HTML, JavaScript and the built-in Ruby API in concert to create compelling applications built on top of SketchUp to customize and/or automate certain tasks.&nbsp; Furthermore, our SDKs provide the ability to read/write SketchUp files and interoperate with the 3D Warehouse. We'll discuss some of the advances in the SketchUp Ruby API and how to integrate your creations with the 3D Warehouse.  <br /><br /><p><em>Speaker Bio:</em> Mark is a product manager who joined Google with the acquisition of @Last Software in 2006. Mark works on Google SketchUp and the Google 3D Warehouse.  Since Mark is a Product Manager and not an engineer, he isn't supposed to be writing code.  But - shhhhh! - he does.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's words from 1891 remain true today.  Researchers in computational linguistics and information retrieval now have a million times more data than was available 30 years ago. This talk explores what this data can do for problems in language understanding, translation, information extraction, and inference, and extrapolates to what more data may bring in the future.</div><div id="video_theorizing_from_data" class="materials"></div></div><div class="session"><div class="title">Fireside Chat: Geo Product Team</div><div class="presenters"></div><div class="abstract">Google Maps API and KML have a very strong and growing community of developers. We aspire to work closely with our community members in evolving these platforms further and meet the diverse needs of our developers. In March we open-sourced the Marker Manager in the Maps API and started an an open source project for Maps API utility libraries. KML is already recognized by OGC as a best-practice for geospatial data. This session is your chance to tell us what you want from Google's geo team, discuss motivations for the open-source project, learn about current libraries and brainstorm possible future extensions.</div></div></div>
