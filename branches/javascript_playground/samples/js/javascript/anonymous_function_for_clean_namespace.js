/* 
 *   Anonymous functions are functions that are dynamically declared at runtime
 * that donâ€™t have to be given a name.
 *   This sample shows how to use an anonymous function to keep the global
 * namespace (window object) clean.  The purpose of this is to keep your code
 * from interfering with other code in the global namespace, which can occur
 * especially when using 3rd party Javascript libraries.
 *   All you have to do is wrap your code inside of this
 * (function() { // CODE HERE })();
 * This code creates a new anonymous function with your code in it, and then
 * executes this function which will initialize your code, but keep it out of
 * the window object.
